### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

I am a driven and experienced engineer with a comprehensive skill set from Ukraine. I am currently in the EU. I like to create cool applications, and I know how the app should look and how it should work to be convenient and useful.

ðŸ’¡ All my achievements are improvements for the business. I founded important tools: 
- Open-source projects [Starter-Kit-Theme](https://github.com/solidbunch/starter-kit-theme) and [Starter-Kit-Foundation](https://github.com/solidbunch/starter-kit-foundation) WordPress boilerplate with docker containers and optimized environments. This stack accelerated the project starting by 5 times and solved scaling and architecture problems
- Authored **Visual Regression Testing tool** - NodeJS app in Docker container. It used to automated compare screenshots of the website and detect visual changes. This tool speeds-up QA process and eliminated 90% of errors
